                           <p>The Annapurna Circuit is one of the most popular treks in Nepal, and rightly so. On this route, the scenery and culture dramatically change from subtropical forests, paddy fields, and the world’s deepest river gorge to ice flows, a high mountain pass, arid cliffs, and mountain views.</p>

                           <p>Passing through Manang, the trek starts with views the Manaslu range, Tibetan-like Buddhist villages, and woodlands, through the Marshyangdi Valley.</p>

                           <p>Heading towards the high Thorong La Pass, a host of mountains come into view, including the Annapurna Massif, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Tilicho Peak.</p>

                           <p>The trail continues over the pass to enter Mustang and the Hindu pilgrimage town of Muktinath and on down the Kali Gandaki Valley, past the unique and interesting village of Marpha with its small monastery, narrow cobbled streets, and apple orchards, on to the hot springs at Tatopani and the view point of Poon Hill.</p>

                           <p>From Poon Hill, it is possible to see more than 20 of the highest mountains within the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges.</p>
